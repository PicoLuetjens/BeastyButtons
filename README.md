## Description

BeastyButtons is a basic GUI Lybrary for Processing, including multiple GUI Widgets, Handlers, Layers an automatic Logging System, an automatic Align System, importing and exporting Layouts as well as Layout Presets.
There are also multiple Surfaces of Widgets supported, as well as animating between them for a transition.
Almost all values are changeble at runtime making it a very variable and flexible system.
You can get References to a Widget by either its ID or its SOURCEPATH - also at Runtime.
Furthermore you can set Widgets active/unactive and visible/invisible. Other supported Features are a Tooltip System and also changing shape and color of widgets. At Creation of Widgets many values are automatically calculated to make the usage a whole lot easier. If you don't want that you can of course overwrite the values afterwords.
